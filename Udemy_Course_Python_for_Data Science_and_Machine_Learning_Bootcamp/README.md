# Course Overview (In Progress)

This course is currently in progress.

The main goal of this course is to strengthen my practical knowledge of the Python data science ecosystem, including:

- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly
- cufflinks
- scikit-learn

Throughout the course, I complete hands-on exercises and mini-projects to reinforce theoretical concepts.
