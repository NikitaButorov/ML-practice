# Course Overview

This course covers fundamental machine learning models and algorithms, including:

- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

It also introduces validation techniques and performance metrics for proper model evaluation.

A significant portion of the course is devoted to data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques.
